In this project, we will explore a gene expression dataset related to Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and perform power and sample size analysis. We are interested in understanding the statistical power and sample size required to detect meaningful differences in gene expression levels between different classes of DLBCL. The dataset originates from Alizadeh et al.'s study conducted at Stanford University.
